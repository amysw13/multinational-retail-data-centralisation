# Multinational Retail Data Centralisation üíº
------------------
### Description

This project is for collating retail sales data for a multinational company, where data is spread across multiple data sources to one centralised database. Facilitating accessibility and analysing for company team members to become more data-driven.

### Aim

Using [![python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-1f425f.svg)](https://www.python.org/) class methods are utilised for **connecting** to data sources, data **extraction** and **cleaning** downloaded data.

Cleaned data will be uploaded to a centralised [![PostgreSQL](https://img.shields.io/badge/PostgreSQL-1f425f.svg)](https://www.postgresql.org) database. The star-based database schema developed manually, ensuring data columns are of the correct data type.

Querying the newly created centralised database to get up-to-date business metrics, using [![PostgreSQL](https://img.shields.io/badge/PostgreSQL-1f425f.svg)](https://www.postgresql.org).
